renamed gdelt-savefeature.py to regionanomaly.py
changed feature.js to new file name

features.js global variables have port # and time start and end buckets so change those globals in the file and in main to run it.
modified small changes in files :
features.js
main.js (doesnt matter)
main.py
traversal.py
urlmakers.py
regionanomaly.py
