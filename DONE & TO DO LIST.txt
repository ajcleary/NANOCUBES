Done:

-added a simple button on the ui find anomalies (select a rectangle)
-added a selection region algorithm to search for anomalies inside the region
-fixed feature function to work
-formatted json data nicely
-formatted the file like this so we can use the feature list for zooming and highlighting:
 	{"description", "geoCenter", "name", "resolution", "tileSelection"{TILES}, "timeSelect", "timeZoom": {"endMilli""startMilli"},"zoomLevel" }  
-changed feature function to display anomalies 
-figured out outdated feature file  
-added full algorithm button( User )               
-fixed hanging debug algorithm or cgi script        
-save file rewriting 
-improved gui to pretty buttons etc.
-global port variable
-added zoom for full anomaly
-fixed time zoom for full anomaly


To Do List:   (for IN PROGRESS items put your initials after the :) add to the list

-set global port, time bin start and end, and min and max levels

regionanomaly.py
-add user inputs time window to the anomaly region 
	selection ( default to full time series )          : 

fullanomaly.py
-add user inputs time window to the full anomaly algorithm: 
-add user inputs for min max levels                        :
